{"name":"Logmyday Android App","tagline":"An android application that simplifies keeping a log of daily values","body":"This is app is a little side project I wrote in a few days to keep my personal log. It allows you to write down and store some daily values, whether it's your mood, your grades, or some medical information, anything you may want to keep track of. It also allows inserting notes (so that it can be used to keep a journal), and setting a daily reminder. The inserted data can be exported as csv.\r\n  \r\n### Download\r\nYou can download the apk from [here](https://github.com/vigliag/LogMyDay/releases/download/v1.0/logmyday_v1.0.apk)\r\nThe only required permission is for writing to the sd card in order to export your data. This app is currently compatible with android 4.1 onwards.\r\n\r\n### What it looks like\r\n<img src=\"imgs/device-2015-09-23-235315.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the main page\" width=\"450px\"/>\r\n\r\n### About your data\r\nAs this is only a little side project, I take no responsibility for the integrity of what you write into the application. For what concerns privacy, however, everything you write stays in the private database of the application, and can only be read by other applications (or sent via internet) after it is exported using the apposite function.\r\n\r\n### Suggestions are welcome!\r\nI'd be happy to receive your opinions and suggestions about this app at vigliag_at_gmail_dot_com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
